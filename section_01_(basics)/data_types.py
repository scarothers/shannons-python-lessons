# Data types: int, float, bool, str

# In Simple Math and Variable Assignment, we saw ints and floats in action.
# Here's a quick refresher.

# ints are whole numbers
print 5 + 2, 5 - 3, 5 * 5, 5 / 2 # 7, 2, 25, 2

# floats are decimal numbers
print 5.4 + 2.1, 5.0 - 3, 5.7 * 5.2, 5 / 2.0 # 7.5, 2.0, 29.64, 2.5

# boolean values store True or False (yes or no)
print 5 > 4 # True
print 3 + 3 <= 1 # False

# Comparison Operators Sneak Peek
#   >    greater than
#   <    less than
#   >=   greater than or equal to
#   <=   less than or equal to
#   !=   not equal to
#   ==   is equal to

# strings are covered in greater detail in Section 2
# But essentially, they contain words, or really, anything you could type on a keyboard
print "Yep, all those print statements you saw before? Those things between the quotes are strings! Yes, I'm a string, too. "

print "Python usually isn't too strict about data types, but there are some things you can't do."

# Uncomment out the next line to get an error!
#print "This line here will cause an error, because you can't add strings to numbers. This is Lesson Section #" + 1
