# Simple Math

# We're going to work with print statements to output the results to the screen.

# You can separate multiple print items with a comma, as shown below:

print "Four times four is ", 4 * 4

# Addition
print "5 + 3 is ", 5 + 3

# Subtraction
print "6 - 2 is ", 6 - 2

# Multiplication
print "10 * 20 is ", 10 * 20

# Division
print "55 / 2 is ", 55 / 2 # Hmm ... !

print "By default, Python treats numbers as whole numbers (integers)"
print "So in a way, Python's answer of 55 / 2 = 27 makes sense, even if it's not quite what we're looking for."
print "Luckily, there are other ways to get the answer we want."

# Precise Division (using floats)
print "55.0 / 2 is ", 55.0 / 2
print "55 / 2.0 is ", 55 / 2.0
print "55.0 / 2.0 is ", 55.0 / 2.0

# Remainder Division
print "55 % 2 is ", 55 % 2 # This is super useful for determining whether a number is odd or even

# Powers
print "2 ** 10 is ", 2 ** 10
